# final_project

This is Project is to create a simple user interface where user can desgin a character by selecting a name and other different features such as hair, eyes, skin, hat and mood. After finishing selecting the properties, the image of the character will be printed on the screen. 

The main problem is to how to connect different choices to different images. To solve this problem, I created a customized class called character which includes the name of the feature and the image.
